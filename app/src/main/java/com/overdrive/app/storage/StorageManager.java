/**
 * StorageManager - SOTA Storage Management for Overdrive
 * 
 * Manages recording and surveillance storage with:
 * - Dedicated directories under /storage/emulated/0/Overdrive/ (internal) or SD card
 * - Storage type selection: INTERNAL or SD_CARD for both recordings and surveillance
 * - Configurable size limits (100MB - 10000MB for SD card)
 * - Automatic cleanup of oldest files when limit is reached
 * - Event-driven cleanup (after each file save)
 * - Periodic background cleanup during long recordings
 * - Thread-safe operations
 * - SD card detection and availability monitoring
 * 
 * SOTA Cleanup Strategy:
 * 1. Pre-recording check - Reserve space before starting
 * 2. Post-file cleanup - Run after each file is closed/saved
 * 3. Periodic cleanup - Background task every 30 seconds during active recording
 * 
 * Storage Selection:
 * - Each storage type (recordings, surveillance) can independently use internal or SD card
 * - SD card paths are auto-discovered via BYD system properties or known mount points
 * - Graceful fallback to internal storage if SD card becomes unavailable
