/**
 * Adapts the daemon's already-running [GpsMonitor] singleton into the RoadSense
 * [Pose] contract (D-020).
 *
 * RoadSense does NOT register its own `LocationManager` — `LocationSidecarService`
 * (app side) already streams GPS to the daemon, and `GpsMonitor` (daemon side)
 * holds the latest fix with staleness metadata. RoadSense, running in the daemon
 * (D-023), reads that singleton. The `GpsRingBuffer` (separate stage) keeps a
 * short history of these [Pose]s for back-projection with fix-latency compensation
 * (R-EXT-2) — this adapter just exposes the current fix.
 *
 * GpsMonitor accessors are simple volatile reads (lat/lng/speed/heading/accuracy
 * + lastUpdate), safe from any thread.
 *
 * Pure read-through, no state, thread-safe. `nowMs` injected for testability.
