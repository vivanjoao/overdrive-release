/**
 * Turns a raw [DetectionCandidate] into a final [Assessment]: a speed- and
 * vehicle-normalized severity bucket, a hazard type, and a 0..1 confidence.
 *
 * Why this exists (R-DET-2, R-DET-4, R-EXT-1, R-EXT-3, D-005, D-011, D-015):
 * the [EventDetector] hands us the *raw* morphology of a vertical event. But the
 * raw jolt is NOT the road severity — it conflates three things:
 *
 *   1. how hard the road actually hit the wheels (what we want),
 *   2. how fast we were going when we hit it (R-DET-4: same pothole at 50 km/h
 *      jolts far harder than at 15 km/h), and
 *   3. how stiff THIS vehicle's suspension is (R-EXT-1: a Seal and a truck feel
 *      the same bump differently).
 *
 * So severity must be a property of the ROAD, not the drive or the car. We:
 *   (1) speed-normalize the peak back to a reference speed (30 km/h),
 *   (2) divide out a per-vehicle scale factor (from the future VehicleCalibrator
 *       — we CONSUME its scalar; we never learn it here, R-EXT-1),
 *   (3) bucket the resulting `normalizedPeak` via the D-011 thresholds.
 *
 * Then, separately, we decide breaker-vs-pothole from event *shape* (03-ARCH
 * "Severity buckets" type rule — type is an orthogonal axis from severity), and
 * compute a confidence (R-EXT-3) that starts LOW when the vehicle calibration is
 * immature (D-015) and is penalized by poor GPS accuracy.
 *
 * HONESTY NOTE: almost every number in here is a first-principles GUESS, not a
 * fit. The thresholds come straight from the provisional D-011 table; the
 * normalization exponent, the noise floor, and all confidence weights are
 * engineering priors chosen to be *reasonable*, not *measured*. Every one is
 * marked PROVISIONAL and is meant to be tuned against the labeled test-drive set
 * (G-1..G-3). The structure is the deliverable; the constants are placeholders.
 *
 * Pure math, no Android deps, stateless — fully unit-testable. `classify` reads
 * only its arguments and the companion consts; it holds no mutable state, so it
 * is trivially thread-safe and reentrant.
